# Image Repository Mutating Admission Controller

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lawrencegripper/MutatingAdmissionsController.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lawrencegripper/MutatingAdmissionsController)

## Status: WIP

This controller will rewrite pods run to Kuberentes with an image repository location of `cluster.local/someimage` to a repository local to the cluster (in the sample it's `rewritten.local/someimage`).

This is a task better suited to some form of pre-processing in the CD pipeline as I beleive using an Admissions controller for this is overly complex and adds a single point of failure for all pod create opterations in your clusters. However, I think the sample is likely of use to others with different scenarios. 

## Running

Lets start our webhook receiver locally.

1. `ngrok http 3000`
2. `â€‹git clone https://github.com/lawrencegripper/ClusterLocalAdmissionsController` and CD into the dir
3. `npm install && npm run watch-server`
4. Update the `./kubernetes/k8s-ngrok.yaml` file's `url` property with your ngrok https endpoint 
5. `k apply -f ./kubernetes/k8s-ngrok.yaml` then run `k apply -f ./kubernetes/testdep.yaml` and see the webhook hit your service and patch the image location

## Testing

Run `npm test`

## What happens in the receiver?

It receives the request it does the following:

1. Clone the incoming pod spec into a new object
2. Make changes to the clone, updating the image location
3. Creates a JSONPatch by comparing the original and the clone
4. Base64 Encodes the JSONPatch data
5. Returns the patch as part of an `admissionResponse` object

## Helm Chart

To deploy the registry rewriter into your cluster you can use the helm chart contained here. You will need the following properties

* CA Root certificate of the cluster this is being deployed into
* URL of registry that should be used for cluster.local images

> To get the root bundle you will need to run the following  
> `kubectl get configmap -n kube-system extension-apiserver-authentication -o=jsonpath='{.data.client-ca-file}' | base64 | tr -d '\n'`

When installing this chart it will include a number of things

* A kubernetes job to create a CSR for the deployment and approve the CSR
* A deployment and service for the webhook itself
* A webhook configuration to tell kubernetes where the webhook is in you cluster

The chart can be found in this repo and can also be consumed from the resources page using

```bash
helm install <url of release> --name registry-rewiter --set containerRegistryUrl=someurl.com,caBundle=<rootbundleasbase64>
```

Once installed you run `k apply -f ./kubernetes/testdep.yaml` to test it has worked. If all is working you should receive

```bash
deployment.apps/example-deployment configured
```

You can also choose to deploy your own custom container image for the webhook by supplying the `webhookImage` value in the values.yaml.
